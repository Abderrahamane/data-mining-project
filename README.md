# Data Mining Project

## 📘 Project Overview
This repository contains the work for our university **Data Mining project**.  
The goal is to explore, prepare, model, and evaluate data to extract meaningful patterns and insights using standard data mining techniques.

We will later define our specific project topic (e.g., prediction, classification, or clustering) during our team meeting.

---

## 🧩 Workflow (CRISP-DM Framework)
Our project follows the **CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology, structured into five main phases:

1. **Data Understanding:** Explore and describe the dataset to understand its structure and potential insights.  
2. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the data for modeling.  
3. **Modeling:** Apply suitable machine learning algorithms.  
4. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance and interpret results.  
5. **Deployment:** Demonstrate how the final model can be used in a real-world context.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
We will use:
- **Python** for analysis and modeling  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for documentation and code organization  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for data processing and visualization  
- **Flask** or **Streamlit** for possible deployment
